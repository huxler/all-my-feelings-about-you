        <p>Hi,</p>
        <p>I want to write down to you everything. That's why I loved you. Why has it happened? And it does not mean I’m trying to convince you, not saying be my girlfriend, not saying I want to talk with you again.</p>
        <p>I want to say I miss you, just, I miss you. Believe me I’ll write these things in all honestly, through my heart. Without cutting out a part even I don't want to say before to you. And I don’t care perhaps you hate some lines and the answers. But all lines tell the truth. Maybe it’s not interest you, or it’s not your problem. But it is important to me, you’re important to me. </p>
        <p>I know we haven’t spent too much time together. Actually, we haven’t been getting along for a while. Because you don’t talk with me anymore, and I understand you, making empathy with you, even if it does not seem like that. How can a guy make empathy with you who disturbs you by calling you out continuously, finds a way to speak with you, refills a glass of water when you are in the kitchen for just a look, gets a smile or just a greeting? He knows you have a relationship, you told him! What a jerk, right? He doesn’t respect your relationship and still chasing you. A man like that shouldn’t be trustable person who values his own relationship.</p>
        <p>Yasmine, every night, my chest is burning. It’s not an imitation, I feel a damaging heat, hearing beats of my heart so hard. Wish god to not having a heart attack. Because it’s like someone pressuring my chest with all its weight. When I go to bed, it starts with thinking of you – during the day I can reduce these thoughts with tasks, hobbies, chores, cook, a thing whatever I can do – but in bed there is nothing to focus on. I start to think about your hair, your eyes, lips, smile, hips, nose, your dimple I love most. Not on my own will, because you have a relationship and we can’t be together. My body realize that and give me the pain which doesn’t allow me to sleep. I turn in my bed try to think another think but just a few minutes I find myself thinking about you again. Waking up 2am, after 3am, after 5am… Sometimes I think, what if you marry? I wake up, wash my face and cry. I’m not writing these because maybe you pity and give me a chance. Yasmine, never pity me and never give me a chance because of this. I’m not a pitiful person. Pitiful persons are not determined as pathetic by their cries. For me, they are pathetic because they give up, don’t get up and stay on the ground. Because it’s easier.</p>
        <p>I didn’t give up on you Yasmine. It doesn’t mean I continue to try to speak with you and make you feel uncomfortable. No, I will try not to speak with you until you talk with me back. Change my way if I see you in front of me as I turn home back or go to the office. You don’t see me too much. But I want just a favor from you. When I come to you just because of my job, let me do my profession. Please don’t show me you are uncomfortable, pouting or blowing. When you do that, you stub a dagger in my heart repeatedly. I don’t try to show you, but it gives me so much pain. I’m angry with myself for turning you, who is such a positive and happy person, to this face. I’m sorry Yasmine. If I could stop myself, if I don’t listen to my heart, I’d see your lovely dimples again.</p>
        <p>And forgive me for that night I want to come to you. It was the fourth or fifth sleepless night. My thought was something like this: “I only came to this life once, and I found one of the rarest things in my life: real love. I want to give it a try. Maybe she accepts me.”  Without thinking about your relationship, knowing you indicate your lines to me. I wanted to try my chance. Because that night, I wanted you Yasmine. I grabbed a red wine, went to your apartment's main door and called you. Tell you whether I come to you. It was the biggest mistake, and I add this regret and shame to myself. This is the part where I suffer the most. I am deeply sorry. But one thing, know that there won’t be anything without your permission. Because I raised a girl who is 14 right now. I’m not only a brother to him; I’m like a father who protects and looks after her. Believe me Yasmine, you don’t need to be uncomfortable near me. Even if I can’t sleep for years, I won’t touch you if you don’t want to. I never hurt you, impossible, and whoever tries to hurt you will find me.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, you can hurt me so easily. Look Yasmine, I started to play basketball in 2nd grade, go to the gym too early, and work on boxing. I’m not the side of the fight, but I mean, I know how to defend myself. But you Yasmine, you can knock me out with a single move of yours. You are my soft point.  I’m a person who has self-confidence, is happy and likes to make his friends smile. But I feel so weak near you because you treat me like I’m not there. And you are right. Every day, I came to the office like I was beaten by a group of people all night. I disturbed you involuntarily, but please finish this punishment. I know girls don’t like unconfidence, and I’d not been an unconfidence man, but around you... I feel stupid and sleepless and nothing to have to talk about. I want to break the ice between us, but you don’t allow it. I even try to come to you in a friendly way.</p>
        <p>Sometimes, you don’t come to mind for hours; my body goes easy on me and understands that I need a rest. Then I come to the office and see you. You are just 5 meters away from me. I try to focus on my job, but I know it’s impossible. I heard your voice, smelled the beautiful perfume scent, heard your laughter, and saw you walk past in front of me. The earphone is not working, the opened window is not working. That’s not mean it’s disturbing me; I love your laugh and everything with your flaws. Just it’s so hard handling those codes when you are on my mind. I even though quit my job, but it seems it will take a while.</p>
        <p>To be honest, Yasmine, I want to marry with you. I’m not making proposal yet. However, I want to marry you. But not instantly, not at age 27 and yours 25. I desire to do plenty of things with you. For example, I want to travel the world with you. Go to your homeland together. Try out some new courses, experience new things, do your hobbies together, do my hobbies together, learn your favourite food, colour, flower, what makes you laugh more… It’s all because I want to share happiness with you, not create happiness for you. You already got your happiness. I can share it by being with you, by taking care of you and living new things with you.</p>
        <p>Why do I want to marry you? When I saw you for the first time, you were just a clever, outgoing and beautiful friend to me. I knew I liked you, but it was not enough for me; there was no intense love in me. Because beauty does not consist just of appearance for me; when I start to know your character, the way you think, how you treat people, how you make fun of people, the way you chit chat, different types of your smile, and your dressing styles. All things are engraved in my mind, played in my subconscious. And it hit me when I realised that I thought of you the time I was coding on my computer. I stopped. At first, I assumed it was temporary, but it wasn’t. I only hold that feeling for 2-3 weeks without telling you anything. That's when I realised the feeling of love is not something you can handle. I must say, I had to declare my love to you.</p>
        <p>I know it wasn’t the right time; we’re working in the same place, but it doesn’t matter, there are tons of couples who are colleagues, have a good relationship and are doing a good job together. And I couldn't hold it in anymore. First, I thought you were going to accept, my heart started beating faster, I didn’t feel the cold weather, and I remembered all the details within the time: I drew you in my mind. I remember the details of what you dressed. You were wearing a black tricot that had grey buttons on your wrist, black trousers, black boots and a black coat that you were covering your smile while I was telling my love to you. But I understood. I swear I understood when I told you, “I want to say it to you; I don’t know if you have a boyfriend.” And I saw your eyes roll down, your smiling face changed. That moment, I understand you have a relationship. There is no need to say, I was already known. </p>
        <p>That moment, in that tiny moment, I realised I lost you. I can’t express what I felt or how I collapsed. I knew there was a love pain for a few days in front of me, and it would be hard. I thought I would forget you, but my brain didn’t stop thinking about you. Neither my heart doesn’t stop beating for you and it keeps me motivated. I tricked myself into assuming you don’t have a relationship. It could be an excuse. Maybe she was not ready. Yes, perhaps I couldn’t express myself totally and say something wrong. And I continued asking for a date to know more about you, to make you know about me. Even if I don’t know your taste, I want to buy you a necklace with a Saturn and a star on it. I don't know why it reminds me of you. It was very kind of you and a sweet gift for me that you accept my gift, although I tried to contact you at every opportunity. Like I’m writing to you right now.</p>
        <p>Even if it is too hard for me, I won’t speak with you again until you want to talk with me or give me a chance in future. I set boundaries for myself to not contact with you. I want you to be comfortable and not be disturbed. And good news for you: I have an operation at the hospital tomorrow. I will rest, and you won’t see me for one week. It helps me stop contacting you. But I still have hope. Maybe one day you understand how much I love you, how deep my love is, and why I chased you every time. Perhaps you pulled away from me because of my persistent behaviour. I don’t know, but I know opinions are changeable. I know how we can have fun together, and I know we can’t have fun all the time; maybe we’d argue sometimes, but even in that time, I would love you.</p>
        <p>Live a beautiful life even if you don't even think about talking to me, even if you don't think about me. I don’t write these things just to say. I mean it. Live a wonderful life for yourself. Be happy, my love. I would do anything for it. I will continue my life too. As I told you, I have a project to do, I have dreams too, future visions to do, and I know how to do it. I know I’ll succeed in the end cause my goal requires consistency, and I work every day for it. I just wanted you to come into my life and accomplish the goals of yours and mine together. As I continue my life, I don’t know how I fill the emptiness in my heart. If you remember, I give you a piece of paper, it says “You are the most precious piece of my puzzle.” It was right. Whichever girl I talk to or see, I only see you, searching for a piece of you from them, trying to find a similar smile, skin, hair... anything whatever matches with you. You’re the only one who fills it; you are the only one for me. Yes, I know who is already in the pocket is not attractive, but I don’t care.</p>
        <p>I have an endless love for you. You can think I’m exaggerating and don’t wait for you, I won’t feel anything to you in the future. But it’s not true cause this is not something written on the spur of the moment. I always admired you, even when you made mistakes. I observed you time by time, and I decided that you are the girl who I want to make a story and go on a journey. I’ve never let you down, it’s my promise. That’s why I will wait for you. Whichever point you stand in your life, your age, your location doesn’t matter; if you want to give me a change in your life, a single text of yours is enough. I hope you will bring us together early to spend our youth together. There is a song that I think of you most when I listen to; even if some lyrics do not fit, it makes me think of you. I’m sharing it with you. As I said, I'll continue my life and continue my goals. I hope you think of us one day; give us a chance. I don’t care how much time it will cost. I’ll wait for you. Because, my lady, love is a long road.</p>
